# global-income-inequality-analysis
## Overview: 
  Income inequality is a global issue reflecting the uneven distribution of wealth within and between countries. Developed nations exhibit varying income levels due to economic policies and labor market dynamics, often resulting in Gini coefficients ranging between 0.3 and 0.4. In contrast, many developing nations experience significantly higher income disparities due to limited access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, with Gini coefficients frequently exceeding 0.4.

Such inequality exacerbates poverty cycles, fuels social tensions, and limits upward mobility. Beyond social consequences, income inequality hampers long-term economic growth and weakens social cohesion. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive policy interventions, including progressive taxation, inclusive labor policies, and equitable distribution of resources. This project aims to explore global income inequality trends through data-driven analysis and visual storytelling.
